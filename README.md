# Airbnb Data Cleaning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing Airbnb dataset(s) to make the data suitable for analysis. The notebook includes techniques for handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring consistency across the dataset. It is an essential step for downstream tasks like exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning.

## Features
- Identification and handling of missing data
- Conversion of data types
- Removal of duplicate entries
- Standardization of textual data
- Generation of summary statistics

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following tools and libraries installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas

You can install the necessary Python library using:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Dataset


This dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata). Ensure that the dataset is placed in the same directory as the notebook or provide the correct path in the code.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Place the Airbnb dataset in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook airbnb_clean.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the cells sequentially to clean and preprocess the data.

## Outputs
- A cleaned dataset saved as a CSV file (if specified in the notebook).
- Summary statistics highlighting the data cleaning process.
